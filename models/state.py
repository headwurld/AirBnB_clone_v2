 State Module for HBNB project
 This module defines the State class, a subclass of BaseModel and Base.
 Attributes:
     __tablename__ (str): The name of the MySQL table to store states.
     name (sqlalchemy.Column): The name of the state, represented as a
     string of up to 128 characters.
     cities (sqlalchemy.orm.relationship or property):
     Represents a relationship
     If a State object is deleted all linked City objects are automatically
     deleted as well.
     If the storage type is not 'db', this attribute is a property that returns
     a list of City instances with state_id equal to the current State.id.
